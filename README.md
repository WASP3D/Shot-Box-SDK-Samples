The Wasp3D SDK helps developers create custom solutions for Broadcast & Interactive graphics. Live Event Graphics 
Developers can use the API to data-bind wasp scenes to various sources of data, scoring applications, wire feeds and 
databases and push it to the Wasp3D rendering engine – Playout Server for on-air playout. The Shotbox 
implementation document helps customers load and playout the wasp scene on the real-time rending server – Playout 
Server.

The Wasp3D Shotbox is a simple API that gives users a high level control over the Playout Server. The API provides 
classes for developers to load and meld data with wasp design templates on Playout Server. The API wraps the 
underlying protocol for communication through helper functions, enabling developers to create custom solutions for 
Broadcast & Interactive graphics. You can connect to multiple Playout-Server(s) using different communication 
channels. You can create from simple to complex applications managing multiple scenes on multiple Playout-Server(s) 
from a single application using WASP3D Shotbox SDK.
